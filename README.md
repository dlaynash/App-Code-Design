# App-Code-Design
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of the application that was developed for Project Seven was to allow the user to log in and register. Another feature that the app includes is that the application should ask the user if they give permission for the application to send out SMS messages. The user can either decline or accept SMS notifications. Lastly, the application provides a grid that displays database information that the user can easily access.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens that were necessary were a login screen, register screen, data display screen, and an SMS notifications screen that grants the application permission to send text messages to the user. I tried to maintain my application simple so that I could focus on the functionality of the application. Although I wish I could have considered the UI design a bit more than I was able to do so. The screens that I was able to finish functioned almost completely as intended. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
For this assignment, I worked on the application in sections. Instead of coding all the necessary components at once, I focoused the necessary screens one by one. This strategy worked well to ensure that my application was functional but it was time-consuming. I believe in the future I could use the same approach once I become more familiar with Android Studios since it was my first time using it. The emulator in Android Studios was leveraged often for testing because it gave me a visual of what needed to be changed. It was pretty cool to use because it was not like any other IDE that I have used. Having a visual can help a lot because it allows you to test sections even if your program is not complete. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
With anything that is done for the first time, there will be challenges. I faced a few challenges this term as I was using unfamiliar tools but I enjoyed the experience overall and how informative it was. The challenge that I found the most interesting was using Firebase to manage users. It was a new concept for me but although it was a challenge at first I was able to leverage google to understand how it supports mobile applications. It inspired me to consider developing an application outside of my courses. Which is something I have not considered in the past. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The registration of my application was my most successful because of the research that I did and once it worked properly I was particularly proud.
